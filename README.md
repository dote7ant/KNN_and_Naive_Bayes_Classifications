# Introduction 

This repository contains two notebooks.
### Notebook 1 (K_Nearest Neighbours)
We have been provided with the titanic data set. We are to this data set to determine whether a passenger survived or not using the KNN classifier.
#### Approach 1: KNNclassifier
#### Approach 2: Random forest classifier

### Notebook2 (Naive Bayes Classifier)
Given the [dataset](https://archive.org/download/spambase_csv/spambase_csv.csv) determine whether a message is in class 0 or class 1.

#### Approach 1: NaiveBayesClassifier
#### Approach 2: Random forest classifier

Build models that apply the above two approaches for each dataset." We will use the following approaches to achieve our objective.


We will compare the accuracy scores  for the above models and rank them on how they perform. We will further challenge our solutions with the random forest classifier.

## Getting Started

## Overview

This repository contains the technical aspects of Data Science Core IP submission week 9 as outlined above. The project applies the classification techniques learnt as well as feature engineering, cross validation, hyperparameter tuning. The notebooks can be accessed above or through the [knn](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1kyimplOpTbwzmgGhcf6mQXqE-c_7ctiE?usp=sharing) and for [Naive Bayes](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1F6Jtt60VJ2c5XSK4MMpmlF2d-YrPa0So?usp=sharing). Feel free to add comments.
